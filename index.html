	 <p>This is the thirteenth conference conference on Artificial
Intelligence and Statistics and the first to be held in
Europe. Formerly AISTATS was held every two years. In the future the
plan is to hold the meeting each year alternating between North
America and Europe. AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of
researchers at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and
related areas. Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of this
conference has been to broaden research in both of these fields by
promoting the exchange of ideas between them. We encourage the
submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective.</p>
	   

	   <h2>Programme Booklet Available</h2>

	   <p>We have prepared a booklet containing abstracts and details of the programme. This will <b><i>not</i></b> be available in printed form at the conference, so please <b>print it out and bring it along with you</b>. It is available <a href="./booklet.pdf">here</a>.

	   <h2>Poster Sizes</h2>

	   <p>Each poster session will contain about 45 posters. There will be 24 panels of approximately 1.5m width and 1m height. There will be a poster on each side of these panels. That means that A0 landscape will be a good fit, but A0 portraint would be a little too big. 

	   <h2>Colocated Events</h2>

	   <p>	   <b>Summer School</b>: Before AISTATS there will be an <a href="http://www.mlss.cc/sardinia10">MLSS Summer School on Machine Learning and Cognitive Science</a>.

	   <p><b>Post Meeting Workshop</b>: After AISTATS there will be a <a href="http://clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/AISTATS2010/">workshop on Active Learning and Experimental Design</a>.
