\begin{abstract}
The Abstract paragraph should be indented 0.25 inch (1.5 picas) on both left and right-hand margins. Use  10~point type, with a vertical

\end{abstract}

\section{General formatting instructions}

Papers are in 2 columns with the overall line width of 6.75~inches (41~picas). Each column is 3.25~inches wide (19.5~picas).  The space
between the columns is .25~inches wide (1.5~picas).  The left margin is 1~inch (6~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of
11~points. Times Roman is the preferred typeface throughout.

Paper title is 16~point, caps/lc, bold, centered between 2~horizontal rules.  Top rule is 4~points thick and bottom rule is 1~point thick.
Allow 1/4~inch space above and below title to rules.

Authors' names are centered, initial caps.  The lead author's name is to be listed first (left-most), and the Co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow.  If only one co-author, center both the author and co-author, side-by-side.

One-half line space between paragraphs, with no indent.

\section{First level headings}

First level headings are all caps (optional), flush left, bold and in point size 12. One line space before the first level heading and 1/2~line space
after the first level heading.

\subsection{Second level heading}

Second level headings must be flush left, all caps, bold and in point size 10. One line space before the second level heading and 1/2~line
space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}

Third level headings must be flush left, initial caps, bold, and in point size 10. One line space before the third level heading and
1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\vskip .5pc Fourth Level Heading

Fourth level headings must be flush left, initial caps and Roman type.  One line space before the fourth level heading and 1/2~line space
after the fourth level heading.

\subsection{CITATIONS, FIGURES, REFERENCES}


\subsubsection{Citations in Text}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and year, e.g., (Cheesman 1985). Reference style should follow the style
that you are used to using, as long as the citation style is consistent.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the text. Use 8 point type for footnotes. Place the footnotes at
the bottom of the page  on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a 0.5 point horizontal rule  1~inch (6~picas) long.\footnote{Sample
of the second footnote}

\subsubsection{Figures}

All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible.  All lines should be very dark for purposes of reproduction and art work should not
be hand-drawn.  Figure number and caption always appear below the figure.  Leave 2 line spaces between the figure and the caption. The
figure caption is initial caps and each figure numbered consecutively.

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page rather than
splitting the figure and figure caption.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{1in} \caption{Sample Figure Caption}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean, and legible. Do not use hand-drawn tables. Table number and title always appear above the table.
See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

One line space before the table title, one line space after the table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be
initial caps and each table numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Sample Table Title} \label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION} \\
\hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Instructions for camera-ready papers}

For the camera-ready paper, please make sure that you follow the next instructions

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install the package \texttt{fancyhdr.sty}. The
    \texttt{aistats2e.sty} file will make use of it.
    \item Begin your document with
    \begin{flushleft}
    \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[twoside]\{article\}}\\
    \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[accepted]\{aistats2e\}}
    \end{flushleft}
    The \texttt{twoside} option for the class article allows the
    package \texttt{fancyhdr.sty} to include headings for even and
    odd numbered pages. The option \texttt{accepted} for the package
    \texttt{aistats.sty} will write a copyright notice at the end of
    the first column of the first page. This option will also print headings for the paper.
    For the \emph{even} pages, the title of the paper will be used as heading and for \emph{odd} pages
    the author names will be used as heading.
    If the title of the paper is too long or the number of authors is too large, the style will print a warning message as heading. If this happens
    additional commands can be used to place as headings shorter versions of the title and the author names. This is explained in the next point.
    \item
    After $\texttt{\textbackslash
    begin\{document\}}$, write
    \begin{flushleft}
    \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{document\}}\\
    \texttt{\textbackslash runningtitle\{Provide here an alternative shorter version of the title of your
    paper\}}\\
    \texttt{\textbackslash runningauthor\{Provide here the surnames of the authors of your paper, all separated by
    commas\}}
    \end{flushleft}
    The text that appears as argument in \texttt{\textbackslash runningtitle}
    will be printed as a heading in the \emph{even} pages. The text that appears as argument in \texttt{\textbackslash runningauthor}
    will be printed as a heading in the \emph{odd} pages.

    If a warning message is printed, please provide shorter versions
    of your paper's title and/or paper's authors, inside \texttt{\textbackslash runningtitle} and/or \texttt{\textbackslash
    runningauthor}.

    \item Use the sample2e.tex as an example.

    \item The camera-ready paper is 8 pages. If you need to include
      additional appendices, you can include them in the supplementary
      material file.  
   
    \item Please, don't change the layout given by the style file. If you have any
    question contact the publications chair.
      

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgements.  All acknowledgements go at the end of the paper.


\subsubsection*{References}

References follow the acknowledgements.  Use unnumbered third level heading for the references.  Any choice of citation style is acceptable
as long as you are consistent. However, bear in mind that you must use the author-year style of citation (see examples above). Citation
using numbers or any other type is not allowed. Additionally, the minimum fontsize for the references is $\texttt{\textbackslash small}$.
Sizes smaller than this one are not allowed.
