      </p><center><a href="http://www.chialagunaresort.com/EN/">Chia Laguna Resort</a></center>
      </p><p>Group room rates are available before <b>March 31, 2010</b>.

      <p>You can book the accommodation using either credit card or bank transfer. To book you need to fill in one of the following forms:
      <ul>
      <li><a href="./reservationForm.pdf">Credit Card reservation form</a> Note that you will need to provide a photocopy of the credit card and your passport (sorry!)</li>
      <li><a href="./reservationFormBank.pdf">Bank Transfer reservation from</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Send forms either by fax, or scan and send via email to the address on the form.

      <p>The deposit is 50 per cent and the hotel will take the full charge for the room when you submit the form.

      <p>The hotel can arrange your transfer to and from the
      airport. The charge for this depends on how many they can pick
      up at the same time. There is space to fill in when your flight
      arrives. Please mark clearly across here NO TRANSFER REQUIRED if
      you don't require the transfer.

      <p>The hotel is "half board" which means they will cover the
      cost of two of your meals. The other meal is paid for as part of
      your registration fee: in other words for conference attendees,
      during the conference, all food is covered by your registration
      and hotel bill.

      <p>The half board nature of the deal means that the cost of a
      single occupancy room is not the same as that of double
      occupancy.
      
      <p>Our contact at the hotel is Alessandro Lusci: he is a local
      Sardinian who speaks good English and can help with any
      particular queries you have you can phone him on +39 070 92 39
      3441 or email alessandro.lusciUSUALSYMBOLhotelchialaguna.com
