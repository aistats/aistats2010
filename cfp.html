<h1>AISTATS*2010 Call for Papers</h1>
<h2>Thirteenth International Conference on <br>Artificial Intelligence and Statistics</h2>
<h3>May 13-15, 2010, Chia Laguna, Sardinia, Italy</h3> 
<!--<br> Collocated with the Learning Workshop, March 19-22, 2007</h3> -->

<p><b>See also <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cfa.html">separate call</a> for Breaking News Abstracts</b>

<p>This is the thirteenth conference on Artificial Intelligence and
Statistics (AISTATS*2010), an interdisciplinary gathering of
researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial
intelligence, statistics, and related areas.

<p>Since its inception the AISTATS conference has been held every two
years in North America. At the 2009 conference, with the support
of the EU funded PASCAL II Network of Excellence (www.pascal-network.org),
the decision was made to bring the conference to Europe for the
first time. Starting in 2010 AISTATS will be held every year,
alternating the venue between Europe and North America.

<p>The Conference Programme will include invited talks, contributed
talks, and posters.  Contributed talks and posters are selected via
a rigorous peer-review process based on 8 page papers.  Accepted
papers will be published as a special issue in the Journal of Machine
Learning Research (JMLR) Workshop and Conference Proceedings Series.

<p>As an innovation for AISTATS*2010, some time at the conference will
be set aside for "breaking news" posters submitted on the basis of
a one-page abstract.  These are reports on ongoing or unpublished
projects, projects already published elsewhere, partially developed
ideas, negative results etc, and are meant as informal forums to
encourage discussion.  The review process of these posters will be
very light-touch but presentation of these at the Conference will
not lead to publication in the Proceedings.

<p>Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of this conference
has been to broaden research at the interface between artificial
intelligence and statistics.  Papers and abstracts on all aspects
of this interface are strongly encouraged, including but not limited
to:

<ul>
<li>active learning and experimental design</li>
<li>applications</li>
<li>approximate and exact inference</li>
<li>Bayesian statistics</li>
<li>causality</li>
<li>classification and regression</li>
<li>graphical models</li>
<li>kernel and large margin methods</li>
<li>latent variable models</li>
<li>model selection and structure learning</li>
<li>neural networks</li>
<li>online learning</li>
<li>optimization and search</li>
<li>unsupervised and semi-supervised learning</li>
<li>reinforcement learning and decision making</li>
<li>statistical databases</li>
<li>statistical software</li>
<li>statistical learning theory</li>
<li>structured and relational learning</li>
<li>visualization of datasets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Requirements:</h3>

<h3>Peer-Reviewed Papers:</h3>

<p>Electronic submission of papers is required. Papers may be up to 8
double-column pages in length; formatting and submission information
can be found on the AI and Statistics Conference Management page.

<p>Submissions will be considered if they are received by 23:59, Friday
November 6th, 2009, Universal Time. Receipt of all submissions will be
confirmed via electronic mail.

<p>Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind review process.
Acceptance notifications will be emailed by February 13th, and
camera-ready final versions (same format) will be due on March 13th,
2010. These papers will be presented at the Conference either as
contributed talks or posters, and will be published as a special issue
in the JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings Series.  Papers for
talks and posters will be treated equally in publication.
