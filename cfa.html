<h2>Thirteenth International Conference on <br>Artificial Intelligence and Statistics</h2>
<h3>May 13-15, 2010, Chia Laguna, Sardinia, Italy</h3> 
<!--<br> Collocated with the Learning Workshop, March 19-22, 2007</h3> -->

<p>This is the thirteenth conference on Artificial Intelligence and
Statistics (AISTATS*2010), an interdisciplinary gathering of
researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial
intelligence, statistics, and related areas.

<p>Since its inception the AISTATS conference has been held every two
years in North America. At the 2009 conference, with the generous
support of the EU funded PASCAL II Network of Excellence
(www.pascal-network.org), the decision was made to bring the
conference to Europe for the first time. Starting in 2010 AISTATS will
be held every year, alternating the venue between Europe and North
America.  AISTATS*2010 is also cosponsored by the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics.

<p>The Conference Programme will include invited talks, peer-reviewed
contributed talks and posters. These contributed talks and posters,
for which the submission date was November 6, 2009, will be published
as full papers. However, in addition, as an innovation for
AISTATS*2010, some time at the conference will be set aside for
"breaking news" posters submitted on the basis of a one-page abstract.
These posters may report on ongoing or unpublished projects, projects
already published elsewhere, partially developed ideas, negative
results etc., and are meant as informal fora to encourage discussion.
Abstracts should summarize and highlight why the projects will be of
interest to the AISTATS community.  The review process of these
abstracts will be very light-touch but presentation of these at the
Conference will NOT lead to publication in the Proceedings.

<p>Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of this conference
has been to broaden research at the interface between artificial
intelligence and statistics.  Abstracts on all aspects of this
interface are strongly encouraged, including but not limited to:

<ul>
<li>active learning and experimental design</li>
<li>applications</li>
<li>approximate and exact inference</li>
<li>Bayesian statistics</li>
<li>causality</li>
<li>classification and regression</li>
<li>graphical models</li>
<li>kernel and large margin methods</li>
<li>latent variable models</li>
<li>model selection and structure learning</li>
<li>neural networks</li>
<li>online learning</li>
<li>optimization and search</li>
<li>unsupervised and semi-supervised learning</li>
<li>reinforcement learning and decision making</li>
<li>statistical databases</li>
<li>statistical software</li>
<li>statistical learning theory</li>
<li>structured and relational learning</li>
<li>visualization of datasets</li>
</ul>


<h3>Submission Requirements for Breaking News Abstracts:</h3>

<p>Electronic submission of one-page double-column abstracts is
required.  Formatting and submission information can be found on the
AI and Statistics Conference page. Submissions will be considered if
they are received by 23:59, Monday March 8th, 2010, Universal Time
(Greenwich Mean Time).

<p>Abstracts will be lightly reviewed.  Acceptance notifications will be emailed by March 26th.  These will be presented as posters at the conference but will not be published.
