         <h1>AISTATS*2010 Local Information</h1>

<p> The most convenient way to arrive at the Chia Laguna resort is to
fly to Cagliari airport. RyanAir, Air One, Eurofly and Alitalia all
have flights to Cagliari from many European destinations. 

<p> We are working with the resort to improve the quality of their
internet access. At the moment they have a 2 Mbps (guaranteed) line
with some wireless access. We will try and upgrade their routers and
increase the speed of the line for the conference, but please do not
take a high speed connection forgranted. Another route to internet
access is to buy a SIM card from Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM), or other
local provider, and purchase one of their internet deals. Obviously
you need a USB modem for this. There is a TIM antenna right next to
the resort which gives a very usable signal.

<p>The resort is about one hour south of the airport. You can request
a transfer from the Airport to the resort when you book your room. The
maximum cost of the transfer will be 90 euros with one individual in a
car (if you take a taxi from the airport the cost will be 100
euros). The cost will reduce if the hotel can share the transfer
between multiple participants.

<p>Another way to arrive at the resort is through a car rental. Please
be confident about your ability to drive in Italy before considering
this route. The car rental locations <b>are</b> now all located on the
airport site. Leave the arrivals and follow the signs to the car
rental locations that are diagonally left across the car park when you
leave the airport. The road between Cagliari and the resort is mostly
single carriageway with a restricted speed limit (50 km/h). There are
speed cameras along most of the route.

<p>The resort is mainly self contained, with most of the local
restaurants participating in a "Dine Around" scheme that will allow
you to eat your meals at the place of your choice. The nearest large
town is Pula about 20 km north of Chia.
